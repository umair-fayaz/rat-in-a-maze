# Rat in a Maze
Rat in a Maze is a problem that can be solved using Backtracking

## Problem Description
A Maze is given as NxN binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in eight directions.<br />
In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination. Note that this is a simple version of the typical Maze problem. For example, a more complex version can be that the rat can move in 4 directions and a more complex version can be with a limited number of moves.
## Compatibility
The code is tested on Code::Blocks running on Windows 10. C graphics was first set up on Code::Blocks.
